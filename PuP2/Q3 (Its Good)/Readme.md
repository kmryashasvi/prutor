# Its Good

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Write a program as per the following specification: The input to the program is a string. The string contains substrings 'not' and 'bad' such that 'bad' comes after 'not'. There are only single occurrences of 'not' and 'bad'. The program outputs a string such that the whole 'not...bad' substring in the input is replaced by 'good'.

### NOTE: In this question, all input strings for evaluation will definitely contain 'not' and 'bad' as substrings, such that 'bad' comes after 'not'.

### EXAMPLES:

INPUT: Food is not bad.<br>
OUTPUT: Food is good.<br>
<br>
INPUT: The lyrics is not that bad!<br>
OUTPUT: The lyrics is good!<br>
