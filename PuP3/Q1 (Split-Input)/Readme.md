# Split-Input
## LAB2
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Write a python program to read from input a string. <br>The input contains COMMA separated integers. The string can also contain spaces before and after COMMA. <br> The output of the program is a list of integers that contains the DOUBLE of all numbers in the input.


### NOTE: 
1. The output value is computed as a list of integers. Use Python's ```print(...)``` to print it.
2. Negative integers and ZERO are allowed in the input.
3. Use python's ```split(...)``` function to process the input string. 

### Examples

Input:<br>
123, 456, 222, 145<br>
Output:<br>
[246, 912, 444, 290]<br>
<br>
Input:<br>
-1, 0, -2, 2, 0, 1<br>
Output:<br>
[-2, 0, -4, 4, 0, 2]<br>
