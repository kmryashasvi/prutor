## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Write a python program to read from input a string. The input contains COMMA separated string values.
 
### The output of the program is the count of string values where 
* the length is >= 2;  AND
* the first and last character of the string value are the same.

### Examples
Input:<br>
abc,xyz,aba,1221,1	<br>
Output:<br>
2<br>
<br>
Input:<br>
abc, xyz , alpha<br>
Output:<br>
