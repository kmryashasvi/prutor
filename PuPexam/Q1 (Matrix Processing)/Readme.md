Matrix Processing<br>
You are given a 2x2 Integer matrix.  You have to process the matrix as described:<br>
1. If the element is EVEN, double it.<br>
2. If the element is ODD, make it zero.<br>
<br>
The input is given in 2 lines. Each line contains 2 integers, separated by one or more spaces.<br>
The output should be the processed matrix, in 2 lines. Each line should contain 2 integers, separated by a single #.<br>
<br>
An example is given below.<br>

### INPUT:
```
1 2
4 5
```
### OUTPUT:
```
0#4
8#0
```

### NOTE: 
Input will contain only integers and space on each line, as described above. There is no need to check for any errors in the input.
